## Description

We created this project where the webpage uses the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to generate random password
with the length of minimum 8 charachters and maximumm of 128 characters.

## Installation

## Usage
Start using the application by first clicking on the "Generate Password" button. It will generate a pop-up on the browser to 
prompt user for the length of the password they want. 
<Strong>(MAKE SURE THE POP-UP(s) ARE ENABLE IN THE BROWSER TO USE THIS APPLICATION !)</Strong>

Once the user selects the password length, the application asks user if they want to include numbers, lowercase, uppercase
and special characters in the password.(The user must select at least one of the condition otherwise system will ask user to
select their choices again with a message stating that they have to select at least one condition.

Once that is done, the randomly generated password is displayed on the textbox in the middle of the page.
